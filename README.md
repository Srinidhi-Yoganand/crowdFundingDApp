# Crowd Funding DApp Smart Contract

This repository contains a Solidity-based crowdfunding platform consisting of two main smart contracts:

1. **crowdFunding**: A smart contract that allows users to create campaigns, fund campaigns by contributing to tiers, and withdraw funds if the campaign is successful.
2. **crowdFundingContract**: A factory contract for creating and managing multiple crowdfunding campaigns.

This project is built using Solidity and deployed on a local Ethereum development environment using **Ganache**. MetaMask is used as the wallet for interacting with the contracts.

## Contracts Overview

1. **crowdFunding Contract**

    This contract allows users to create crowdfunding campaigns with the following features:

    - **Create a campaign**: A user can create a campaign with a name, description, goal amount, and deadline.
    - **Contribute to tiers**: A campaign owner can define multiple funding tiers, each with a specified amount. Backers can fund campaigns by contributing to one of the available tiers.
    - **Withdraw funds**: If a campaign reaches its goal by the deadline, the owner can withdraw the funds.
    - **Refund**: If the campaign fails (goal amount not reached by the deadline), backers can claim refunds.

2. **crowdFundingContract (Factory Contract)**

    The factory contract allows users to create and manage multiple crowdfunding campaigns. It supports the following:

    - **Create campaigns**: Users can create new campaigns via the factory contract, which then deploys the crowdFunding contract.
    - **View campaigns**: Users can view the campaigns they have created or all available campaigns.
    - **Pause/unpause contract**: The owner of the factory contract can pause or unpause the contract.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srinidhi-Yoganand/crowdFundingSmartContract.git
   cd crowdFundingSmartContract
   ```
   
2. **Install dependencies**:
  Make sure you have **Truffle** installed. If not, you can install them via the following commands:

    ```bash 
    npm install -g truffle
    ```

3. **Start Ganache**:
    - Open Ganache (either the desktop application or Ganache CLI).
    - Create a new workspace or use an existing workspace.
    - Ensure the network is running on port 8545 (default).

    ```bash
    ganache-cli -p 8545
    ```

4. **Configure MetaMask**:
    - Open MetaMask and configure it to connect to Ganache by adding a custom RPC network.
    - Use the following configuration:
      - Network Name: Ganache
      - RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545
      - Chain ID: 1337
      - Currency Symbol: ETH
    - To send money to a wallet, you can use the following `curl` command, replacing the `from`, `to`, and `value` with your specific details:

      ```bash
      curl -X POST --data 
      '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_sendTransaction","params":[{"from":"<GANACHE_ADDRESS>","to":"<METAMASK_ADDRESS>","value":"<YOUR_AMOUNT_IN_HEX>"}],"id":1}' 
      http://127.0.0.1:8545
      ```

## Deployment

1. **Compile the contracts**:
    Before deploying, compile the Solidity contracts using Truffle:

    ```bash
    truffle compile
    ```

2. **Deploy the contracts**:
    Once the contracts are compiled, deploy them to the Ganache network:
    ```bash
    truffle migrate --network development
    ```
    This will deploy both the crowdFundingContract (factory) and the crowdFunding contracts to the local Ganache network.
  
3. **Verify deployment**:
    After deployment, Truffle will display the deployed contract addresses. You can use these addresses to interact with the contracts via MetaMask or through Truffle's console.
  
## Interacting with the Smart Contracts

  After deploying the contracts, you will be able to interact with them via our frontend DApp. 

  ### Crowd Funding DApp Frontend (Coming Soon)
  Please refer to the upcoming frontend repository to clone and run the DApp once itâ€™s ready. The repository link and steps will be provided here.
  Stay tuned for further updates!
